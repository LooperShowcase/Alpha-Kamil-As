        Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə]
        ⓘ), commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça
        ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona,
        Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish
        football. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and
        English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of
        Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More
        than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and
        operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable sports team in the
        world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club
        in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.<br />[2][3]
        The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume
        Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark
        shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.
        Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31
        Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two
        Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the
        latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has
        won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles,
        a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super
        Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin
        Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[5][6][7] Barcelona was ranked
        first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics
        Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the
        ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023.[8][9][10] The
        club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between
        the two teams are referred to as El Clásico. Barcelona is one of the
        most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the
        largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[11][12]
        Barcelona players have won a record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with
        recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record seven FIFA World
        Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo,
        Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the
        club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen
        as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards,
        an unprecedented feat for players from the same football
        academy.[13][14] Additionally, players representing the club have won a
        record eight European Golden Shoe awards.[15] Barcelona is one of three
        founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated
        from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic
        Bilbao and Real Madrid.[16][17] In 2009, Barcelona became the first
        Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa
        del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first
        Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single
        year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA
        Club World Cup.[18] In 2011, the club became European champions again,
        winning five trophies.[19] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen
        trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some
        in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[20][21][22] By winning
        their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique,
        Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve
        the continental treble twice.[23
